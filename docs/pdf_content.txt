🚀 Getting Started Guide
Clinical Intelligence Platform – What to Build, How to Build It, and
How to Start
This document is a  starter manual. You should be able to read this and know: - what models you are
building - what data they use - how to create training data - what to implement first (without being a doctor)
🧠 1. The Core Goal (Read This First)
Goal: Build a system that detects slow patient deterioration over time and warns humans
early.
The system: - ❌ does NOT diagnose - ❌ does NOT prescribe treatment - ✅ only says: “Risk is increasing
over time — please review”
Everything else in this document exists to serve that goal.
🧩 2. High-Level System Pipeline (Mental Model)
Raw visits (rows)
   ↓
Time-indexed patient timeline
   ↓
Trend features (math)
   ↓
Risk scoring (ML)
   ↓
Explanation (rules)
   ↓
UI graphs + alerts
   ↓
Human decision
Keep this pipeline in mind while building. Each box is a separate responsibility.

📦 3. What Data You Start With
Raw input data (example)
Patient: Raj
Age: 52
Date        Blood Sugar   BP        Notes
-----------------------------------------
2023-01-01     110        130/85    "Borderline"
2023-07-01     118        135/88    "Monitor"
2024-01-01     126        140/92    "High"
2024-07-01     142        150/95    "Medication started"
Important: - Each row = one visit - This data is not directly used by ML - It must be converted into a timeline
first
⏱️ 4. Patient Timeline (Your First Backend Task)
Convert visits into time-series format:
{
"patient_id": "raj_001",
"metrics": {
"blood_sugar": [
{"date": "2023-01-01", "value": 110},
{"date": "2023-07-01", "value": 118},
{"date": "2024-01-01", "value": 126},
{"date": "2024-07-01", "value": 142}
]
}
}
This timeline is used by: - UI graphs - Trend detection - Risk scoring
📐 5. Model 1 – Trend Detector (NO ML)
Purpose
Turn raw timelines into trend features.
2

Input
Time-series values.
Output (example)
{
"metric": "blood_sugar",
"trend_direction": "UP",
"percent_change": 29,
"duration_months": 18,
"persistence": true
}
How to implement
Percent change
Linear slope
Count of consecutive increases
Time duration
📌 This step is deterministic math. No training.
🤖 6. Model 2 – Risk Scoring Model (MAIN ML)
Purpose
Answer:
Given these trends, how worried should we be?
Inputs (IMPORTANT)
The model never sees raw values like 110  or 142 .
It only sees trend features:
{
"age": 52,
"sugar_percent_change": 29,
"sugar_trend_up": 1,
"bp_trend_up": 1,
"trend_duration_months": 18,
• 
• 
• 
• 
3

"medication_delay": 1
}
Outputs
{
"risk_score": 0.78,
"risk_level": "HIGH",
"confidence": 0.82
}
Recommended models (in order)
Logistic Regression (start here)
Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost / LightGBM)
Small Neural Network (only later)
📌 Do NOT use transformers or LSTMs early.
🏷️ 7. How Training Data Actually Looks
Each training row represents:
“What was the patient’s trend state at time T, and did something bad happen later?”
Example training row
{
"age": 55,
"sugar_percent_change": 30,
"bp_trend_up": 1,
"trend_duration_months": 18,
"medication_delay": 1,
"label": 1
}
label = 1  → deterioration happened later
label = 0  → no deterioration
Labels are based on future events, not diagnoses.

🧪 8. How to Create Training Data (Realistic Plan)
Phase 1: Synthetic Data (YOU MUST DO THIS)
Manually generate realistic feature rows
Define simple rules for labels
Goal: test pipeline, not accuracy
📌 Every real healthcare project does this first.
Phase 2: Public Medical Datasets
Once pipeline works: - Use public ICU datasets (e.g. MIMIC, eICU) - Extract timelines - Compute trend
features - Label based on outcomes (ICU transfer, death, escalation)
You are learning patterns, not deploying these models.
Phase 3: Human Feedback (Future)
In real deployment: - Clinicians acknowledge / dismiss alerts - Feedback becomes labels - Model thresholds
are calibrated
No uncontrolled auto-learning.
🧾 9. Model 3 – Explanation Generator (NO ML)
Purpose
Explain why risk increased.
Input
Top contributing trend features.
Output
Risk increased because:
- Blood sugar rose 29% over 18 months
• 
• 
• 
5

- Blood pressure increased across 4 visits
- Medication was delayed
Rules
No diagnosis
No treatment advice
Facts + time only
📊 10. What the UI Uses
The UI consumes: - Patient timelines → line graphs - Trend features → arrows / highlights - Risk scores →
risk-over-time graph - Explanations → callouts
The UI never plots: - LLM text - Predictions - Diagnoses
🧱 11. What to Build FIRST (Very Important)
Order of implementation
Patient timeline data model
Trend detector
UI graphs from timelines
Synthetic training data
Risk scoring model
Explanation generator
Do NOT jump to ML first.
🧠 Final One-Line Summary
This system converts scattered visits into a computable story, detects when the story
worsens, and explains why — safely.
